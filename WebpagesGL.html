	<p>Hello1 My name is Ethan Loeffelholz, I am a current student at NC State University.
	I am originally from just outside of Chicago but moved to Clayton, NC, for my senior year of high school.
	In the future I hope to get my masters degree in biomedical engineering, and possibly get a phd in neuroscience.
	When I am not at class I enjoy working out, playing lacrosse, practicing martial arts, playing piano, and playing video games.
